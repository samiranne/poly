 - A struct to hold information about the target and the CAS protein being used.
 - A substruct to hold information about the CAS protein (PAM, references, functionality (cut, tag))
 - Maybe a small embedded DB of common CAS variants and their properties.
 - A basic heuristic for determining the viability of a potential gRNA candidate. This should include:
 -- Checking for off-target hits in the target organism
 -- Checking that the gRNA itself can be synthesized
 -- Checking that gRNA GC content is within the 40-80% range.
 -- sgRNA should be between 17-24 nucleotides
